% =====================
%
% Function that iterates the LMS algorithm.
%
% INPUTS
%%% d:  vector with reference signal.
%%% x:  vector with input signal.
%%% P:  number of coefficients of the filter to be estimated (must be even).
%%% mu: convergence coefficient (non-normalized).
%
% OUTPUTS
%%% H:  Matrix with filter coefficients for each time instant.
%%%       * Rows      -> coefficients.
%%%       * Columns   -> time.
%%% y:  Vector with adaptive filter output as a function of time.
%%% e:  Vector with error signal as a function of time.
